A quick primer on working as a programmer on team 5806. This will include information on the usage of git, WPILib, eclipse, control theory, and sensors. This document is a work in progress and all help is appreciated!

## Git

Git is our version control system. A VCS is used for sharing code changes between programmers. [Here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a tutorial on how to use github. [Here](http://juristr.com/blog/2013/04/git-explained/) is a nice, more in-depth primar on working with git.

### GUI git

[Here](https://desktop.github.com/) is the link to github's desktop git program.

### Command line git

To get to the repo's folder, use `cd`. Here is how you make a commit:

```git add . && git commit -m "PUT COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"```

Here is how you sync that commit:
